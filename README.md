# Customer-segmentation-analysis-for-marketing
<b> Purpose of the Analysis </b> <br>

The main purpose of this analysis of customer information is to get an understanding of customer purchase behaviour and their response to various marketing campaigns.

We can break down the list of customers into groups or segments and create marketing campaigns targetted towards customers belonging to a particular segment.
Essentially, the content of the marketing campaign can be customised to appeal to different types of customers;
targeting the prime audience and maximising the ROI from marketing.<br><br>

<b>Research Goals</b><br>

We have the following research goals in this analysis:<br>

Identify "main clusters" or segments of customers for the retail firm.<br>
Identify the major channels of purchase of each cluster to maximize growth.<br>
We would like to know what are the most dissimilar groups of customers and what makes them dissimilar.<br>
Finally, we would like to know what are the customer attributes that characterise each cluster.<br>
